# acro

a game engine making it a breeze for developers to build, hack, and inspect their games.

## Motivation

When making games with engines like Unity and Godot, I find it difficult to debug and iterate. Debugging came down to adding print statements to everything and hoping I could figure out what was going on. Compilation was slow and scripting tooling were all over the place, making me lose motivation to continue working on the game.

The code -> compile -> play -> debug -> repeat cycle is slow and cumbersome. I want to make a game engine where the feedback is virtually instant and debug tools is built-in.

Also I want to make a game engine :).

## Using

uhhhh....

it's very much not finished but you can just `cargo run` (rust 1.80.0) in the root of the project to
run whatever example I made. you can edit the example and the game will refresh when it's running

_current status of project_: bunch of random ui elements and a spinning teapot
